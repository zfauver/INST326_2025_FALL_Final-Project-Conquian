Explanation of each file:
- conquian.py: the main file for the game
- read.me: Document explaining the project and how the program works.

Running the game:
- Command: python conquian.py
- terminal inputs:
  - y/n for melding a card, if the card is not meldable the game will not let you meld the card (required)
  - the card you would like to meld needs to be inputed (required)



Clear instructions on how to use your program and/or interpret the output of the program. Anything the user might encounter while using your program that a random person on the street would not find self-explanatory needs to be explained in your instructions.

Attribution: in order to evaluate whether each member has made a substantial, original contribution to the project, please provide a table like the one below, with a separate row for each method or function.

|Method/function|Primary author|Techniques demonstrated|

| optimal_meld  | Baran Sayan  | Generator expression  |
| meld_from_hand| Baran Sayan  | lambda expressions    |


Method/function	Primary author 	Techniques demonstrated
Tunnel.find_connections	Avery Student	sequence unpacking
parse_args	Frankie Learner	ArgumentParser class

In the table, list all methods and functions that are being claimed by any member of the group in fulfillment of item 7 above. Only list the techniques that are being claimed in fulfillment of item 7d (for example, three functions may contain f-strings, but only one member of the group can claim f-strings and they should only be listed once in the table).
